    <p>
        The first chapter introduced four types of javascript values: booleans, strings, numbers and undefined values. <br/>
        These values can be created by typing in their names, for example (null, true) or value, (12, "abc").<br/>
        I also learnt about operators and logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programs are built with statements, statements contain expressions. <br/>
        Using statements one after the other allows the program to be executed from top to bottom, <br/>
        disturbances can be brought into the flow using conditional and looping statements like<br/>
        (if, else, switch) and (while, do, for).<br/>
        Bindings are used to file pieces of data under a name and are useful for tracking state in programs.<br/>
        Functions are special values that contain a piece of program.<br/>
        You can call a function by writing functionName(argument).
